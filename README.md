# Bias in AI - Gender Bias in Income Prediction

## Description

The coursework for this sub-module required the creation of a machine learning model which mitigated bias towards a single protected class. For my project, I decided to mitigate bias between genders on the [UCI Adult Income](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult) dataset, using the *Classification with No Discrimination* method outlined by [Kamiran and Calders](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.182.6067&rep=rep1&type=pdf).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this repository was downloaded from [datahub](https://datahub.io/machine-learning/adult) and is derived from the [original UCI dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult).

## Report
The project was expected to be delivered alongside a 3 page report which outlined the purpose of the project and assessed the effects of the chosen mitigation method.

The report can be found in [project_report.pdf](https://github.com/boyla950/bias_in_ai_coursework/blob/main/project_report.pdf).

## Essay
It was also required to submit a 1-page essay which reviewed a selected paper on the topic of Bias in AI and presented my own views on the future of the field.

## Feedback
Full feedback for the assignment can be found in [feedback.txt](https://github.com/boyla950/bias_in_ai_coursework/blob/main/feedback.txt). The final mark received was **97.5%**.
